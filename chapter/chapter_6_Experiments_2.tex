\subsection{Interfacing}

\subsubsection{Training Interface}
We've implemented real-time visualization of the training process and results of the model using Visdom. This integration has enhanced our ability to monitor and analyze the evolution of the model's performance at every epoch. With it, we can dynamically visualize various metrics such as loss functions, image translations, and other relevant statistics, providing us with valuable insights into the model's behavior and enabling us to make informed decisions for optimization.

\subsubsection{User Interface}
A simple UI (figure \ref{fig:fuser_interface})has been developed using React and FastAPI for easier interaction with the model.
