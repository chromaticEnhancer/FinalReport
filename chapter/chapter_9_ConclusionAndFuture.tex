\\
As per future enhancements following can be considered:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use of  contrastive-unpaired-translation to reduce the time and resources required for training\cite{park2020contrastive}
        \item Better hardware can be used to train image in higher resolution to get more quality results
        \item Better and larger datasets can be used to accomodate colorization of variety of scenarios
    \end{itemize}
